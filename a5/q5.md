## Q5

Based on this homework assignment, we've seen that LSTMs and RNNs are effective,
if not perfect, models for forecasting volatility of financial assets. GARCH is
designed for estimating volatility of time series, and both the LSTM and RNN
had close (but slightly worse) performance. However, the LSTM and RNN might be
able to use additional data points more effectively than GARCH. Lastly, the
markets are not a closed system - as "hype" and other factors can play
as big a role as fundamentals in terms of pricing - therefore, some amount of
error is to be expected.
