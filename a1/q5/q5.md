## Q5

A KNN model that outperforms the given linear model can be constructed as follows: 
```R
model = FNN::knn.reg(
  train = scale(train_data[, -1]),
  test = scale(train_data[, -1]),
  y = train_data$y,
  k = 6
)
```

This model uses scaled X data and a `k` value of 6. It has a test RSME of `1.182593` which is significantly lower than the
linear model, which had a test RSME of `3.495659`.
