## Q1

| Model | Train RMSE | Test RMSE | Num Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1.44834 | 1.424781 | 4 |
| 2 | 1.159677 | 1.11978 | 7 |
| 3 | 0.5070891 | 0.5269903 | 13 |
| 4 | 0.5044712 | 0.5332113 | 18 |

Model 3 is best at making predictions because it has the smallest Test RMSE.

## Q5

A KNN model that outperforms the given linear model can be constructed as follows: 
```R
model = FNN::knn.reg(train = scale(train_data[, -1]), test = scale(train_data[, -1]), y = train_data$y, k = 6)
```

This model uses scaled X data and a `k` value of 6. It has a test RSME of `1.182593` which is significantly lower than the
linear model, which had a test RSME of `3.495659`.
