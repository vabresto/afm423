## Q2

| Model | RMSE |
|---|---|
| Additive Linear | 2177.782 |
| Elastic (Additive) | 2187.159 |
| Elastic (Interactions) | 2006.594 |
| KNN | 2075.144 |
| KNN (Interactions) | 2099.755 |
| KNN (Scaled) | 2097.179 |
| KNN (Interactions) (Scaled) | 2084.172 |
| Random Forest | 1871.15 |

The Random Forest approach had the lowest test RMSE, and is thus the best model.
The additive linear model is very weak, and is likely not a good fit for
this problem. The KNNs all generally did poorly suggesting there might be lots of
overlapping of the classes. The Elastic Net with interactions was the second best
model, however the elastic net with additive predictors was the worst model, which
suggests that the elastic net itself may not be a good choice, and to instead look
into lasso and ridge as well and see what those results look like.
