## Q3

One possible reason why it may have been easy to find a k-NN model that met the stated criteria
(as opposed to the linear model) is that the data may be fundamentally clustered (as opposed to fundamentally
linear). This would mean that a clustering approach like nearest neighbours would more readily
find representative patterns versus what a linear model could do.
