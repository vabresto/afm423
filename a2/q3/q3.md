## Q3

| Model | Bias | Variance | MSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.04901667 | 0.00840924 | 0.05742591 |
| 2 | 5.530704e-05 | 0.008471189 | 0.008526496 |
| 3 | 0.0007167326 | 0.02291368 | 0.02363041 |

Model 2 is best at making predictions because it has the smallest MSE. As a sanity check, it is also the closest to the ground truth model we used, so this makes sense.
