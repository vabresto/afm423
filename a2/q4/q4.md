Models `k = 5` and `k = 7` performed best as they had the lowest test error/=. 


| Cut-Off | Sensitivity | Specificity | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1 | 0.950 | 0.800 | 0.86 |
| 0.5 | 0.8250 | 0.9667 | 0.91 |
| 0.9 | 0.5750 | 0.9833 | 0.82 |

Model 2 (cut-off = 0.5) performed the best as it had the highest accuracy and a very low false negative rate.
