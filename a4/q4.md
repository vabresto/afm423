## Q4

1. Yes. The cross-validation needs to train five different models whereas the
out of bag model only needs one. 

2. Yes. They both chose the model with mtry = 1.

3. Both random forest models did markedly better than the other two models. This
is reasonable because the data was in a mixed spiral shape, so we'd expect any
logistic/linear boundary to perform poorly. The cross-validated random forest did
slightly better than the out of bag one, which makes sense, because it gets to
choose the best of five trained models.
