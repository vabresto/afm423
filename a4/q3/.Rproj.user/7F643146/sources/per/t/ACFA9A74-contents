## Q3

| Model | Tuning Parameters | Test Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| Linear SVM | c = 0.25 | 0.82397 |
| Polynomial SVM | degree = 1, scale = 0.1, c = 1 | 0.8314607 |
| Radial SVM | sigma = 0.125, c = 2 | 0.8314607 |
| Random Forest | mtry = 9 | 0.8183521 |

The Polynomial and Radial SVMs are tied with the highest test accuracy. All of the SVM models did better
than the Random Forest.
